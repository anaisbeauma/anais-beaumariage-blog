| General topic    | Microplastic in the air in the French Pyrennes    |
| Procedure/ what was examined    |  - Collecting microplastic falling out of the air for five mounts  - Separate plastic bits  - Identified them by type, amount and origin    |
| Conclusion/discovery    | - Huge travel of microplastic in the wind  - Similar amount of microplastic in the air of Paris and in mountain  - Different types of microplastic: polypropylene or PET in Paris and polystyrene or polyethylene in the French Pyrennes    |
| Remaining questions    | Consequences for the environnement and humain health ?    |
