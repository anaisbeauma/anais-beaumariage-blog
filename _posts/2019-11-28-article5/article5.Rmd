|  Researchers   |Donna Fuscaldo,  Alfred Wegener Institute and the Swiss WSL Institute for Snow and Avalanche Research,  Dr. Melanie Bergmann and Dr. Gunnar Gerdts  |
| Published in ? When ?    | in  Science Advances    |
| General topic    | The biggest source of microplastic in California coastal waters    |
| Procedure/ what was examined    |  -  Find and examine microplastic from stomachs of marine organisms and in ocean water  - Create a baseline for future monitoring and fix standards for sample |
| Conclusion/discovery    | - 70% of climate cooling is due to fossil-fuel emissions  - Biggest source of microplastic pollution in California's coastal waters :are tires  - 7 trillion piecies of microplastics washed into the San Francisco Bay each year  - Harming impacts on sea tutles, whales, fish, seals, seabirds |
| Remaining questions    | Do these contaminants transfer though the food chain ? How to study more easily microplastic ?    |
